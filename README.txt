# :notes: Between-Us-Game
This project has been developed using Java as programming language, and I used IntelliJ Ultimate IDEA as IDE to develop the code in Java. I have used MySQL for the database.
# :computer: Functioning
First of all, the user has to create a database in MySQL using any tool that allows to do so, e.g. MySQL Workbench. 
After that, the database has to be added in the IDE. To do that, I have to click in the right corner were puts Database. 
When you click on it, a drop-down menu will open in which you have to click on the + button and then select Data Source and MySQL. 
Another window will open in which I have to enter the name I have given to the database, in our case DPO, the user (root) and the password. 
Finally, click on Apply and OK and I will have the database added in IntelliJ Ultimate. Then, it has to be configured using the file contained in the folder “Database”. 
Once I have opened this file, I copy the content of it and I paste it in the QueryConsole of IntelliJ Ultimate. After that, I will have the database ready to be used.

Once the database has been succesfully configured, to execute the code, the "Software" folder includes the project that has to be opened with IntelliJ IDEA. 
After opening the project, the Main.java file inside the src folder has to be opened. 
Once in Main.java, the public void main method has to be exectued, after that the code will run.
